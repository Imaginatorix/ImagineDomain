                                                This project, aside from making me learn networking, taught me how to
                                                learn subjects that I have no history working with yet. It taught me that
                                                most, if not all, solutions would eventually be found when piecing
                                                together the information you gathered on the internet and that there are
                                                several sources for anything you can find. Stackoverflow (for when you're stuck),
                                                W3Schools (for live demo), Tutorialspoint (for several information about a function
                                                or method), the Documentation itself, YouTube (for tutorials), and many more.
                                                The ones stated above may not only be used for that sole purpose, but it is
                                                what I use it most of the time. Further, this is also the first project I placed
                                                in github, telling how much this project made me more close to the programming
                                                community and how proud I am of this project.
                                            </p>
                                            <p class="indented mt-2">
                                                This also taught me the philosophy, <i>"If what they gave you is too complicated,
                                                then make it yourself to understand it."</i> Paradoxical? In a way... but that's learning.
                                                This project started on the earliest parts of
                                                quarantine, and I'm sure you can now find the reason why I made it.

                                                This project was one of the projects that made me learn about algorithms and recursion.
                                                This made me realize I may have stepped too far out of my comfort zone... but I did it
                                                anyways, and it was fun and extremely worth it. At this time, the only algorithms
                                                I knew were bubble sort and binary sort that don't have recursion. So, much more do I not know
                                                searching algorithms with recursion. It was like my brain received an expansion pack, and
                                                I want to have that feeling again. It was at this time I planned on how I learn things.
                                                Currently, the farthest in my plan is Machine Learning or Deep Learning (I am still unsure
                                                of their difference), so I wanted to have a Mummy Maze solver cause I want to see what happens
                                                at the end. But I prerequisite my ML journey with CS50ai, which I again prerequisite myself
                                                with CS50x (and there's certificate) in case I missed some stuff.

                                                it made some redundant moves, I'm not sure how it made redundant moves, but I'm still

                                                taste to web scraping and data science, I'll say it was a good experience.

                                                This project taught me that computer science can be used as a tool to speed up the sciences.
                                                Be it as a platform or as the medium as which research can be done on. In fact, out planned research
                                                will be related to this. This project also introduced me website hosting. I used Heroku for the first time
                                                in here, but unfortunately, Heroku is no longer free.

                                                This project taught me that some programs may not be compatible with your system, and thus,
                                                you needed to find a work around. In this case, while initially it started out as that
                                                I wanted to run a specific program from a YouTuber (which turns out to incompatible with Windows),
                                                into a project which makes me use other libraries (usually more low level) to create a functionality
                                                of another library. Which forces me to understand things in a much more deeper level compared to before.

                                                This project taught me how important it is to communicate your workflow to the possible user,
                                                or even fellow programmers. This can give more transparency and offers a more human friendly
                                                language so that it can easily be modified. This was the first time I added a flowchart to my project.
